<!--more-->

## Appearance 
Kreel is a tall, lanky dwarf with a bristly, iron-gray beard, deep-set eyes and bushy eyebrows. He wears the typical dockworker's patched and stained coveralls, with a Starfinder Society badge on his chest.

## Background
Kreel came from the Diaspora, and was known to have ties to the local mining groups. An investor into the Hardscrabble Collective, he championed for miners' rights and opposed corporations known to exploit their employees, like Astral Extractions, whose safety violations caused a mining accident that killed his cousin.

After the mysterious arrival of the Acreon and an asteroid towed behind it, both the Hardscrabble Collective and Astral Extractions laid claim to it. During a crossfire between the Salakau 369 and the Hukbalahap, Kreel was murdered by the Downside Kings, who made him look like a simple bystander caught in the firefight.
