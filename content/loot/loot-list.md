## Unique & Notable Items

Item                                  | Current Owner 
--------------------------            |:---------------:
[Perfume, Pheromonal Lv. 5](#perfume) | Lotana
[Chemalyzer](#chem)                   | Lotana

### Perfume, Pheromonal Lv. 5 {#perfume}
10 Doses; a single dose lasts an hour.

There is an immeasurable variety of perfumes and colognes in the galaxy, most tailored to teh aesthetics of specific races with olfactory senses.  A single dose of perfume lasts 1 hour, and a typical bottle of perfume contains 10 doses.

Phenomenal perfumes have been specially designed to influence members of a specific species; grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Charisma-based checks against members of that species.  A creature with active environmental protections is immune to the effects of phenomenal perfume.

### Chemalyzer {#chem}
Capacity 20; Usage / 2 use

This handheld unit includes an extendable wand tipped with a sampling nozzle and can be easily operated with a single hand.  It grants a +4 circumstance bonus to Engineering, Mysticism and Physical Science checks to identify an unknown drug, medicinal or other chemical substance

### Scanner, Video Camera
Capacity 20; Usage 2/hour

The most typical scanner is a video camera, which requires one hand to use. A video camera has ordinary sight and is capable of seeing whatever an ordinary human could see, with up to 10 times magnification. A video camera can record up to 4 hours of footage, which can be downloaded and viewed using nearly any computer.

### Laser Drill
Capacity 20; Usage 1/minute

A laser drill is a handheld item that resembles a snub-nosed pistol. As a standard action, you can use the drill to create a hole 1 inch in diameter and 1 inch deep in stationary and unattended materials with a hardness of 15 or less, such as concrete, plastic, or wood. At the GM’s discretion, you might be able to use a laser drill on harder materials as a full action or longer. Detecting a laser drill at work requires a successful DC 15 Perception check. A laser drill isn’t generally useful in combat, but it can deal 1 fire damage with a successful melee attack as an improvised weapon.

### Frictionless Gel
Sold in plastic tubes, this clear gel is a suspension of millions of microscopic spherical beads that reduce friction between objects. As a standard action, you can apply a dose of frictionless gel to your body to grant yourself a +4 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to use the escape task. You must have at least one hand free to open the tube and apply the gel. A tube contains 5 uses of frictionless gel, and a single use lasts for 1 minute.

### Storage Goo 500
When not in use, storage goo is a ball of slightly luminous putty, 6 inches in diameter, with the consistency of soft chewing gum. Skittermander mystics concocted this goo long ago as a novelty. The stuff’s usefulness, especially for smuggling, has seen its manufacture spread throughout the Veskarium and across known space.

As a standard action, you can squeeze the goo to activate it. If the goo isn’t storing any items, this causes it to glow with blue light and remain active for up to 1 minute. While the goo is active, you can store up to 1 bulk of objects within it without changing the goo’s shape or size, as the objects appear to be deconstructed into blue light. You can store analog one-handed melee weapons, tools, and other simple objects, provided they are no more complex than analog melee weapons and require no power.

If you activate goo that has stored objects inside, those objects reemerge, almost as if they’re being reconstructed in a display of blue light. If you’re holding the goo when the objects reemerge, you can have as many reappear in your hands as you have hands free, and the rest fall to the ground in your space. Once the goo releases stored objects, it turns to dust.

### Serum of Appearance Change

Upon drinking this elixir, your coloration and the general form of your features instantly and permanently changes. Within the range that is normal for your race and sex, you can select any skin tone, hair and eye color, and alter the nature of such things as the shape or your nose or chin, the length of your fingers, broadness of your frame, and so on. You are still recognizable as yourself unless you attempt a Disguise check to alter your features enough to conceal your identity (comparing the result of this Disguise check to any effort to determine if you are the same person as your original appearance). In no case can you take on the exact appearance of another creature (even with a Disguise check; the level of control is not that fine).

### Signal Jammer Level 4
Capacity 12; Usage 1/10 minute

This handheld device, originally designed by the Stewards for military uses, is used by corporations and criminals alike. Signal jammers are available at any item level from 1 to 20 and can be purchased for a price equal to 100 credits × the square of the item level of the jammer. When activated, a signal jammer interrupts broadcast signals within 4 miles. If attached to a larger broadcasting station (such as those found aboard a starship), the range increases to 12 miles. A signal jammer blocks all communication devices from sending and receiving broadcasts. Each signal jammer is designed to affect one specific broadcasting medium (such as radio or wireless). You can attempt a Computers or Engineering check to bypass a signal jammer’s effects or to determine the location of the jammer. The DC to bypass a signal jammer is 15 + the signal jammer’s level, and attempting this check takes 1 minute.

### Ion Tape 275
Ion tape is a ribbon of material tightly wound around a spindle. A roll of ion tape fits in the palm of a human hand and comes in a wide range of colors. A single roll contains 50 feet of tape. A single strip of tape is easy to cut through or tear. It has a weak adhesive that keeps the tape in place when wrapped around an object. When ion tape is exposed to an electrical charge of any power (including a jolt from a zipstick), the tape bonds into a single mass of plastic-like material, gaining hardness 8 and 15 Hit Points. When used to bind a creature, a few strips of activated ion tape require a successful DC 28 Strength check to break. A second jolt from an electrical source causes the tape to revert to its weaker ribbon state, at which point it can be torn easily. A strip of ion tape can hold about 5 pounds of weight normally, but when activated via a jolt, a single hardened strip can support up to 300 pounds. The uses for ion tape are many: it can be used to construct basic objects (such as a ladder), patch holes, bind prisoners, and so on.

### Zipstick 10
Capacity 20; Usage 1/use

A zipstick is a small pen-like device used to administer a small jolt of electricity. This jolt is enough to deal 1 electricity damage with a successful melee attack as an improvised weapon. A zipstick is most often used to activate or deactivate ion-bonding technology, such as ion tape.

### Serum of Sex Shift
Mass production has rendered this once-rare serum easy and inexpensive to obtain among the Pact Worlds. Upon drinking this elixir, your biology instantly transforms to take on a set of sexual characteristics of your choice, changing both your appearance and physiology accordingly. You have some mild control over the details of this change, but you retain a strong “family resemblance” to your former appearance.

The elixir’s magic functions instantaneously and cannot be dispelled. Your new anatomy is as healthy and functional as your previous body’s, potentially allowing you to conceive, carry, or bear children (depending on your species’ biology). Drinking a second elixir of sex shift either reverts you back to a former form or allows you to adopt other sexual characteristics, as you choose. The elixir has no effect if you are unwilling, and the presence of certain sex-specific biological processes, such as gestation, may prevent this serum from taking effect.

### Lawfinder 1200
This archaic, ornate compass is a holy trinket sacred to AbadarCorp, and its needle is shaped like a thin golden key. A lawfinder’s needle always points toward the nearest settlement of at least 1,000 people; within such a settlement, the needle points to the primary center of government or civil administration for the settlement. This item can’t detect a settlement more than 100 miles away, except for settlements with the bureaucratic quality, which a lawfinder can detect up to 1,000 miles away. If no such settlements are within range, the lawfinder’s needle spins slowly.

As long as the lawfinder’s needle points to a settlement or civil center, it grants you a +2 insight bonus to Survival checks to avoid getting lost.

### Portable Grinder
Capacity 20; Usage 1/use

Based on protocite reclaimers, this grinder has flat-toothed discs that interlock and rotate toward one another. A multistage mechanism allows these grinders to break material down into junk or polyfluid. The initial stage renders 1 bulk of technological items into 1 bulk of inert electronic equipment suitable as a target for some spells, such as battle junkbot. Further grinding produces polyfluid that flows into a swappable tank that itself weighs 1 bulk empty. Polyfluid can be gleaned from both analog and technological items. In any case, the material you produce is worth 10% of the original item’s value. The weight of the polyfluid produced is determined by that monetary value.
A portable grinder requires a battery. It takes 1 charge and 1 minute to grind 1 bulk of items into junk. Another charge and minute are required to produce polyfluid.

### Tetred Certified Translator
Capacity 10; Usage 1/hour

This elaborate datapad has several additional audio receptors to capture nearby sounds. If you don’t share a language with creatures you encounter, you can activate this device to collect basic linguistic information. The device requires 10 minutes of observed conversation to gain enough information to operate. The device then acts as a rudimentary translator. It does not allow you to converse with creatures with whom you don’t share a language, but it can relate very basic information. Examples of statements the device could interpret would be: “come with us,” “lower your weapons,” or “leave immediately.” The device cannot parse proper names, including personal designations or the names of items and places. Some extraordinary complex or obscure languages might not translate clearly with this device.
