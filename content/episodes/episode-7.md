Your party journeys through the caverns scared.  Your first encounter is a bunch of void zombies, and just when you think you won the battle, a drift dead comes through the walls and attacks you.  N35T0r is scared and yet the party defeats these horrible incorporeal creatures.  As you as exploring this asteroid, you discover that this cavern is not natural but made by a sentient creature.  You find a hallway that goes into the voids of space; you find another hallway that seems to do the same thing, almost as if this rock was connected to something else.

After your battles with these awful creatures and searching the cavernous parts, you discover a door and it opens to a part that seems more akin to a space ship than an asteroid.  You find an old computer system and ancient writings.  It seems to be a control room of sorts.  There is no time to rest because in the corner a security robot activates and starts to attack the party.
