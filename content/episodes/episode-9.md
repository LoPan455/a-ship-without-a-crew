Eric, Jeremy, Cuy, 

Fought Herp Zomibe and some floaty things.  Searched it.  Found a diary. 

Brought the Noquall on the ship.  Theyscuttled over to the dritrock.  Encouterd the Groakakquall.  It was a disaster.  
We decided that this should fullfull the mission to the Starfinder Society.  

We are thinking we take this stuff back to Absolom Station to complete the quest.
