The next day, on your way to the docking bay where the Hippocampus shuttle is docked, you encounter Ice Cube again and he apologizes for all the drama and tries to make it right, but you can tell he is backpedaling because he sent complete rookies on a super important mission on accident.  It is what happens when you are disorganized and have no management training.

Nevertheless, you fly out of Absalom Station on the Hippocampus towards the Acreon.  On route, you get attacked by an undead vessel that cannot seem to do a whole lot of damage and you destroy it before reaching your destination.

Outside the Acreon, you fly around it and inspect the ship and the drift rock which is tethered with a tow cable from behind.  You fly your ship next to the rear airlocks which are open and squee sends a cable to the Acreon which you use to get over.  When your entire party is over, you enter the ship and a set of glowing eyes menacingly stare at you in the dark.
