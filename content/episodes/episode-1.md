In the transport ship Okimoro, we meet our first PC’s.  A young Lashunta of the Korasha Dimorphism stands tough, brash, and eager to adventure.  Next to her is an android that looks serious, but not as serious as another android.  The androids are trying to not make eye contact, but mainly because it means they will have to make small talk which they do not want at this present moment.

All of our PC’ have been in contact with Duravor Kreel, the Starfinder Society scout, and asked to meet him at Docking Bay 94.  From here he will show them the Society campus and introduce them to Chiskisk who is going to help the PC’s get set up on Absalom Station.

Meanwhile, what looks like a cosmetically ordained human starts the small talk.  The transport ship is cramped.  He introduces himself as Asher Banipaul and asks names.  The Lashunta volunteers her names eagerly as Lotana.  Asher says “did you say Lafonda”, and she corrects him with a confusing “No, it’s Lotana”.  Asher then giggles and asks the two androids their names.  It would have been easy to avoid conversation, but the awkwardness of being asked together causes a tripping match to answer the human.  “My name is Derus and I do not want to talk with you” says the more serious android.  “My name is N35T0R and I have no interest in talking or describing what I look like either,” says the other android.  Asher is perceptive and does not bother them further.

On Docking Bay 94 waits two other PC’s; an experienced Ysoki and an inexperienced Shirren.  These PC’s know each other, waiting for Kreel, not talking.  The Ysoki knows better than to engage the Shirren in conversation unless he wants to get bombarded with questions and would you rathers’.

As the ship arrives, the PC’s are unloading, looking for Kreel, and soon they see him pushing through the crowds to meet his guests.  He never reaches them, because immediately gunfire breaks out and creates panic among the crowd.  People are hiding, running, and screaming everywhere.  As the PC’s are getting cover and trying to make sense of things, Kreel goes down.

As the crowd starts to disperse, the PC’s can start to see who is shooting and it looks like two street gangs are firing at each other and now the PC’s are caught in the crossfire.  After much shooting and killing, the last of the gang members flee.  The Ysoki is next to Kreel and he discovers he is dead!  The five PC’s accomplished their first task: they met Kreel at Docking Bay 94, but they did not want it to go like this. 

Station security shows up, interrogates the PC’s, finds them not guilty, and the 5 characters realize that they all had Kreel in common and they all were asked to meet him there.  The Ysoki introduces himself as Cuy, Uncle Cuy, if you like.  The Shirren speaks to the group without a mouth, but telepathically and says “my name is Squee”.  After introductions, they decide to travel to the Starfinder Society headquarters together with Kreel’s comm unit.

Once on campus, they have to deal with their first secretary, then once in Chiskisk’s office they have to deal with their second secretary.  From that point they share with Chiskisk the news about Kreel and he is very sorry that the PC’s had to deal with it and that it was not a normal introduction to the Starfinder Society, but that it would be a good opportunity for the PC’s to investigate his death which seems to have been a murder.  They accept the mission and Chiskisk gives them a recommendation for a place to sleep called “Moons of Sleep” located just a short walk from the parks and towers of the Eye.  As they are heading down in the elevator, they can see through the glass the other elevator going up has Asher, smiling and waving at the group.  Soon outside the building, they hear a faint sound of a gunshot in the building.  Hmm. I wonder what that was.  Oh well, let’s get freshened up and head to the bar.
