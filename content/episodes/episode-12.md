Once the blood stopped flowing, the party searched the last remaining cavern.  There they find a metal door, easily open it, and enter into a large cylindrical chamber.  In this room are multiple doors, each with their own computer terminal and control screen.  The video team is getting all the players reactions to this weird chamber, but its boring and so Waz decides not to use the footage for the show.  In the end you assume it is a control room in the center of this moon that is used as a simulator.  Each door and set of controls lead to another world within the moon.

As much as you would love to spend the next 12 months exploring each world, Waz is aleady bored with your party and wants to end the episode there and head back to the ship.  You inquire about the dwarves, but you are not in control and can only sympathize with them.  This is the world in which we now live, the world of those with power, the world of bureaucracy, and a world in which warriors are not as important as they once were.

Back on the ship, Zo! awards you gifts based on your fan engagement, all of which are weird and heavily labeled with endorsements.  Before you lose your minds in partying and drugs, Cube talks to you.  He pays you the 1500$ each, and you sense that is is broke and wondering how he is going to make that money back.  As important as the money is, He stresses that he has found some clues about the Drift Rock and that he set-up a connection for you on Castrovel with a fellow SS member named Whaloss.  

Cube says his goodbyes and Nor allows you to party, each in their own way.  He invites N35t0r to a personal viewing of the SS droids most recent season.  Zo!'s personal theater is like no other, and once N35t0r is seated, he opens the ceiling to space and they watch some episodes together hoping not to lose the remote to the void of space.  Some others choose to head to the bar and look for companionship and drugs.  Specifically Squee is looking for drugs.  Lotana helps him, and the best they find is a druggie who recommends a dealer on Akiton.  Once everyone is sober, you head out only to find some sick monster sucking on your starship cables.

After a lame encounter with these creatures, you fix the ship and head to Akiton.  As much as you all want to learn and explore Akiton, Uncle Cuy ate some undead hors d'oeuvres  and is shitting all over the starship, so you make your trip short.  Squee finds the drug dealer he was looking for, finds the drugs to grow in his garden, and as they also get a glimpse of a young anakin skywalker. Jack and Eclipse stay behind to clean up the shit.  Lastly, Derus finds a gross augmentation shop to give him some alterations (did that actually happen? I forgot).

You fire up the dirty whore and take her out into space.  The navigator punches in the coordinates and pilot takes her into the drift.  You are in the drift for 8 days and at the end you emerge into the middle of a chaotic planar bubble. 

AWWW, What will happen next?  Is this the end of our heroes?  Will the Dirty Whore see another day of flight?

Please add anything I missed.
