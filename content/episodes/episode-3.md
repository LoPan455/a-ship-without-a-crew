Still at the Fusion Queen, Uncle Cuy, opens the door to the back room and the party proceeds to use all their firepower to kill Ferani Nadaz and her first LT. Vrokilayo Hatchbuster.  After looting her office, they found a white male tied up in the back room.  His name is Jack Burton and he said he is from Earth, wherever that is.  Without much hesitation, this loosely tied party of killers extends an invite to this man who they just met.

The entire team heads to the Starfinder Society to tell Chiskisk that they think they know who killed Kreel.  When they get there, the secretary acts as if the PC’s are strangers, so she calls down her supervisor.  The party meets Ice Cube who asks you to come to his office where he explains that Chiskisk killed himself and that things right now in the Starfinder Society are a mess.  He has nothing for you in regards to the Kreel investigation and thanks you for your help.  Meanwhile he gives you an invite from the Eox embassy and asks you to check into it while he sorts out the mess that the Chiskisk left in the wake of this death.

The party heads over to the Eox Embassy, meets another secretary, this time he is undead.  He takes the invite and directs you to Gervalosk Nor’s Office.  Nor discusses the drama between the Hardscrabble Collective and the Astral Extractions and asks if you can investigate the Acreon for him.  He is the mediator but also wants you to retrieve a package for him that is on the Acreon and return it to him.

After you accept the mission, he sends a hover drone to record all of your events while on the Acreon and Drift Rock.  He also sends some help with you.  Another android comes from behind and Nor tells you that he will be helpful to your mission and his name is Eclipse.

You spend the night, shop and gear up for the investigation.
