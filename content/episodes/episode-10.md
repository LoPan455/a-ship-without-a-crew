We landed back on the Space Station landing bay.  

We logged in to run some searching on ourselves to see what the Station knows of us. 

Dr. Dre knows that everything that's happend due to the GoPro.  

We have loot, 2 ships.  The Hippocampus powers down.  We grabbed all the stuff and moved it into our new space.  Cracked into the new ship, and put it on lock down.  Cuy git all of that sorted.  We had to modify ths=e ship to make it so no one can just fly off with the ship.  Eochs embassy has a lease on thos spot.  It's not theirs;  but they can contorl this dock.  We destoryed, 3 Android Sisters, the other two we don't know.  The last one was not quite...OE.  It was heavily modified.  We recorded what happened.  

We texted Nor to come down to the dock.  

He came down to meet us. 

SEnsed motive, he was not 100%, Initimidate check succeeds.  Nor opened the box, a glowing light emanates from the box.  Somebody(?) gets out.  Hebiza Escolar. Nor needed her, she's the closest to the corpse fleet.  She's undead and looks badass.  In this like Han Solo carbonite.

"She's working with Corpse fleet, isn't allowed in Absolom.  Working with Eox".  Hebiza isn't welcome.  When the undead planet joined the pact worlds.  SOme didn't want to, so they became the Corpse Fleet.  Eox denies that they're in cahoots with them They're like a rogue faction.  But it looks like Nor and Hebiza are tyring to have a pow-wow.  Nor had hired the Hardscrabble to transport her in.  But when the ship was quarantined, it really messed with the plan.  Hebiza and Nor conferred privately for a moment.  Hebiza has in's with the Corpse Fleet.  The Corpse Fleet is an insurgency.  They're undread and citizens of Eox.  Hebiza is just someone with connections.  

Hardscrabble always takes side jobs, Nor asked them to rendezvous with a ship and bring back a package.  The ACreon ran into hard times, crew was killed and it was quarantied.  Nor felt it was a good opportunity to mediate to get what he needed. He was acting behind the scenes to keep the Corpse Fleet from wreaking havoc on the Eox's place in the PActworlds.  Corpse Fleet was probably after Hebiza, Nor speculated.  

Hebiza was imporessed with our wish to defend the pact worlds from the Corpse Fleet.  She knows where one of their bases are.  One of the goals of thiis meeting was how to infiltrate or handle the knowledge of this secret base.  Theere is a place where there was a hideout.  

Suggested we go to Fluffy Meteor.  In the arms.  Mgr is not a talker.  Depatine Coo.  


Cuy and Squee stayed on the ship.  to get soemting going.  The rest of us went to the Fluffy Muffin.  

Death Prince Depa Tinku met us at the door.  He [ushed back the antique droid.  We sold our shit.  Outside the arms shop, Lotana was approached by this gnarly Vesk.  He wouldn't join.  Knick Knockerson.  Recognized him as a highly respected Star Knight.  He was quite aware of our accomplished.  He gave a patch, a pen, that I could attach onto my armor.  Asked about the corpose fleet.  They have sent forces out against both high and low.  The Absol=om govn't calls on them.  His suggestion was to stick with the Starfinder society.  His suggestion was that due to to Charisma and attractiveness  The invites...handed us these elctronic invites.  tot he next hottest show of Starsugar Heartlove.  We received seven tickets to the show.  WE got Knick's comm link.  Asked wehre they hang out, where is their guild hall.  They train on a ship and perhaps and cetnral training.  Lotana would be welcome to come and hang, train, whatever, healing, resto, that sort of thing.  

Duck is where we go for ship upgrades.  


We have tickets for a concert Starsugar Heartlove.

Learned about the markings on tship:  They were in the past, but have to go to Castrovel to find out more.  Not pressing.  

Nor and Habiza told us about the Corpse Fleet secret base they want to infiltrate/investigate, mutually exclusive with from the Game Show 

Take the corpose back to her Star Grave

We brought the ship into Duck's.  While we were dealing with our loot.  Cargo hold is now modified.  Duck put "Pork Chop Express" into the cargo hold. There is now a garden in that.  It's because the trailer is fufll of food.  Provides sustenance for six.  

We got JAck Burton Healed.  We learned from the healer that she'd once lived on a planet known as Golarion.  There are lots of afflictions that have low DCs, but are devastating if you get thems. 

For items, most stuff is available, Aboslom STation has lots of goods.  

We go to meet up with Zoh.  We can ask Zoh a bunch of questions.
