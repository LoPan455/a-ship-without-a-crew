_Note: Due to the Great Creator moving his family out into a random field in the wilderness of deep suburbia, we have three episodes in digest form for your reading pleasure.  Executive Summaries, if you will.  You're busy, God's busy, this is the best we're going to get._

## Session 12 (7/12/2019)
Remember Zo?  Well, you finish the game show, get paid and enjoy some downtime on his space yacht.  You discover that the small moon was nothing more than a weird hamster cage situation.  Cube encourages you to head to Castrovel, but you insist on fulfilling Moriko Nash's last request in order to solidify the ownership of her ship to your group, which does not have a captain, only a loose band of bad decision-makers.  

## Session 13 (8/9/2019)  
You enter the drift and reach the coordinates only to come out in a debris field which almost took your lives and your ship.  Before you bury the body of Moriko Nash, you head into a broken-down ship and explore its contents.  There you find an uplifted bear and give him a down lifted day.  You kill their friend and we finished the session there.

## Session 14 (9/4/2019)
Remember the Tiefling you killed?  Well, you meet a Shimreen and have to tell her you killed her best technology officer.  She cries crystals.  You bury Moriko Nash's body, explore, and head to Castrovel.  You level-up.  You meet your Starfinder Liason names "Whaloss" (more like Lame-ass) and he takes you to the home of Dr. Solstarni who is the leading expert on the elvish writings you found on the drift rock.  You take a canoe out to her island home and are attacked by some people who insist you must die.  You do not die, instead, they die and you level up.  Congratulations you are all heroes.

## Overall Recrap of the Events that Got Us Here

* You are individually asked to join the Starfinders by Duravor Kreel.
* You meet him at Absalom Station and he is killed by gang thugs.
* You are acquitted of any murder charges by the authorities.
* Chiskisk asks you to investigate Kreel's Murder.
* Find out he had some ties to the Hardscrabble collective.
* The H.Collective and Astral Extractions hired muscle to help their cases in regards to the drift rock and the disappearance of the crew of the Acreon.
* Realizing that Chiskisk is dead, your group is assigned Ice Cube as your direct director and he thanks you for investigating and nonchalantly sends you on an errand which turns out to be super important.
* The Undead Eoxian ambassador Gervalarsk Nor asks you to investigate the Acreon because he is mediating between the two parties involved.  Cube comes back to you sorry that he treated you badly and tries to get on your good side.
* After lots of killing you discover the crew of the Acreon discovered this "drift rock" which hosted the Akata which ended up killing them, along with that gross garaggakal that almost killed you all.
* the inside of the drift rock was some "darma initiative" looking technology thing that had some ancient elvish writing that you discovered.
* you find a ship named the sunrise maiden and rename in morning wood or something as equally stupid.
* Moriko Nash asks you to bury her body at specific coordinates.
* You saved some goblins that are at babcocks apartment, I think.
* afterward you become celebrities and are partake of a game show hosted by the famous Zo!
* you find this weird moon to be an experimental twilight zone type place but can do nothing more for the poor saps who still live there.
* Fulfilling Moriko's requests, you find her final resting place and another ship that had crashed landed.  It is another group of Starfinders who are their burying Moriko's brother and it seems all too weird, but you all head to Castrovel at the request of Ice Cube to investigate those elvish hieroglyphics.
