In this chamber or mechanical room you fight this security robot and eventually defeat it.  You send it back to the hippocampus for parts or to sell to an antique dealer.  Meanwhile, the goblins are still on the hippocampus with Lotana, Eclipse (whom you decide is a male dancer).

You continue to inspect the corridor and find the dead body of Moriko Nash.  Derus takes a battery and puts it into her comm unit and after a minor hack; you listen to her message and last words:

“I think I have come to terms with it.  I won’t survive, but at least I have kept it safe.  I guess everything comes to an end eventually.  I was so close to finding the key!  This is my last will and testament.  To whoever finds this recording, I leave the Sunrise Maiden to you.  It’s a good ship, and no matter where I’ve gone, it’s always brought me home (well until now).  If you treat it right, it’ll do the same for you.  Leave my body at the following coordinates which you can find on the Maidens’ main computer.  Make sure you do not let them have it back.

Based on her testament, she was exploring and after she realized that she was not going to defeat a gross monster, trapped herself and eventually starved to death.  She left her ship to you if you return her remains to a specified location listed on the ships logs.

You press on and end up in a docking bay and see the most beautiful ship you have ever seen.  It’s beautiful because it’s yours, or at least it can be.  But this moment is cut short by the grossest monster you have faced yet.  It is slimy and has a face that is all teeth and no personality.  The fight is brutal, but your quick thinking Shirren traps the monster with a sticky bomb which gives you enough time to bombard it with your ballistic weapons until it explodes and sends guts all over the party.
