You fight your way through these ugly creatures of disgustingness.  Jack Burton gets bit and contracts Void Death.  Derus gets bit and contracts it as well.  Although the others are getting bit, they seem to avoid the disease.  As you search your way through the ship you discover more of these creatures and their cocoons from which they came.  You do not seem to discover any of the crew members, but in one of the rooms you find a pair of goblins and after almost killing them, you discover they are harmless.  They share that they are three and one has been killed.  They only came over to see if they could salvage anything and do not have a ship.  Their names are Shadrach, Meshach, and the dead one is Abednego.  You send them back to the Hippocampus with Lotana and Eclipse who are watching the ship. Uncle Cuy gives them his personal puzzle and they are distracted from all other mischief that would harm the ship or others.

In one of the cargo rooms you find the cargo that Nor wants you to bring back to him.  You figure that there is no need to open the package and send it back to the Hippocampus for safe keeping.  After you search the entire ship you end up on the bridge trying to hack into the main computer.  The party dings Level 2!
