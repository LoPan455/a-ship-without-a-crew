Finally you hack into the Acreon main computer and find the ship log stating in several entries:

  "After our assigned mission was a failure, finding no minerals in the directed area, we discovered a strange asteroid in the drift plane.  Our scanners shown a rock and metal reading, so we decided to keep it in tow until we came out of the drift and explore it better.  Our hopes are that it may have some minerals of value to help off-set the cost of this pointless expedition.

 

  Today we sent an exploratory team to the asteroid and they came back with geodes of some kind.  It shows a sort of metallic property to it, probably worth 500 credits each.  We were not able to explore the asteroid in detail as we came close to a nebula storm and need to move the ship to a different quadrant.

 

  We are wrong about the Geodes.  It is not a mineral, although it has a metallic exterior and most likely still worth 500 credits, is actually a cocoon of an alien species we are not familiar with.  We know this because today it hatched.  We all smoked cigars to celebrate the first birth on the Acreon ever.

 

  We are wrong yet again.  The creature that birthed here was not harmful during its infancy, but with its insane growth rate, it soon became hungry nipping at anyone who came close to it.  Carmichael, one of our engineers tried to restrain it, but as he was holding it down, some of his sweat dripped onto the creature.  Yet only a small bit of bodily fluid, the amount of pain must have been extreme, for that beast rapidly attacked Carmichael.  We are trying to detain the creature in hopes that we do not have to kill it, but in the meantime we are making a salt water compound which we think will kill it, but I hope the others do not hatch and it does not hurt any more of my crew.

 

  Emergency log entry:  My name is Thozzurim Oakthane and I am the Captain of the Acreon.  Purging the Airlock did not work, as they do not seem to need air, so I’ve set the autopilot to continue to Absalom Station, but we’re abandoning ship.  We’ll fall back to the rock and try to regroup there.""

 

You think that the ship’s crew is back on the drift rock, so you load up the hippocampus with all the loot, cocoons, and goblins and head over to the drift rock.  Here you experience zero gravity and it is scary, most especially for Uncle Cuy.  While at the entrance of one cave, you start to get attacked from far away, by a sniper android.  You race up to her location and with the help of some magic missiles almost kill her.  Her name is  Clara-247 and sister to the pilot who attacked you on your way here.  She is pissed because she thinks you killed her sister and before you can further interrogate her, she kicks off into the void of space never to be heard from again.
